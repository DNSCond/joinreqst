# JoinRequest Archiver

Automatically archives all pending join requests for a subreddit.

## Use Case

After successfully reclaiming a **Private** or **Restricted** subreddit through [r/redditrequest](https://reddit.com/r/redditrequest), you'll likely end up with a backlog of join requests. This bot helps you bulk-clear them in one go. (or at least it would, if it worked)

## Activation

Access the bot via the subreddit menu item labeled "ArchiveAll" in your subreddit's moderator tools.
When activated, the bot adds a private note to each archived modmail, stating "u/[YourUsername] told me to archive this modmail"
ensuring transparency with your moderator team. (and even outside before bug in version "0.1.2 - heatedFixtionallity")

## Custom Message Textbox

The bot includes a textbox for sending custom replies to users whose modmails are archived.
This feature, allows moderators to craft a message that is sent to all affected users.
Use placeholders like `{{author}}` or `{{subreddit}}` to customize the message dynamically.
For example, entering `Hello u/{{author}}, your request to join r/{{subreddit}} has been archived.`
will send a message to each user, replacing placeholders with their username and the subreddit name.

**Note**: leave the field empty to not send the message to the user.

## Placeholders

All placeholders are case-insensitive and can be used in message templates:

| Placeholder         | Replaced With           | Example    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| `{{author}}`        | The author's username   | `antboiy`  |
| `{{username}}`      | Same as `{{author}}`    | `antboiy`  |
| `{{user}}`          | Same as `{{author}}`    | `antboiy`  |
| `{{subreddit}}`     | The subreddit's name    | `DrawMyOc` |
| `{{subredditName}}` | Same as `{{subreddit}}` | `DrawMyOc` |

> Tip: Use `u/{{author}}` or `r/{{subreddit}}` in messages to link to users or subreddits.

- All
- New
